# segmentions
Segmentions is a script that aims to analyzes YouTube video subtitles/comments for emotional content. It uses the YouTube API to fetch comments, filters them, groups them into segments based on their timestamps, and then uses a pre-trained emotion classification model to analyze the emotion of each segment. The segments are then saved as separate video files, with the file name indicating the start time of the segment and the top three emotions detected in the segment.

White it does function, it doesn't yield the most usable results. Proceed with that in mind.
